## Security Requirements From Research

Based on the security research document, the following critical security requirements have been implemented:

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization - MOSTLY COMPLETE
- [x] Service account token-based authentication for KSM
- [x] Principle of least privilege (vault isolation via profiles)
- [x] Time-limited access grants with expiration (session timeout)
- [ ] OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for MCP authentication (not needed for stdio MCP)
- [ ] Emergency revocation mechanisms (can revoke KSM tokens externally)

### ✅ Input Validation & Protection - COMPLETE
- [x] Strict allowlists for input patterns
- [x] Parameter validation against schemas
- [x] Shell command escaping and sanitization
- [x] Output sanitization to prevent feedback loops
- [x] Protection against command injection (comprehensive validation)

### ✅ Credential Security - COMPLETE
- [x] Never store passwords in config files (encrypted storage)
- [x] Just-in-time credential retrieval
- [x] Automatic credential expiration (via KSM)
- [x] Service account permissions with least privilege
- [x] Secure credential management integration

### ✅ User Control & Confirmation - COMPLETE
- [x] Risk-based confirmation systems
- [x] Granular permission models (per operation)
- [x] Contextual authentication for high-risk operations
- [x] Real-time disclosure of AI access attempts
- [x] Comprehensive audit logs

### ✅ Protection Against Attacks - MOSTLY COMPLETE
- [x] Tool masquerading prevention (strict tool validation)
- [x] Prompt injection attack mitigation (input validation)
- [x] Centralized token storage security (encrypted profiles)
- [x] Human oversight maintenance (confirmation prompts)
- [ ] Cross-Prompt Injection (XPIA) protection (limited by MCP design)

## Implementation Priority Order
1. **Core Security** (crypto, storage) - CRITICAL
2. **KSM Integration** - HIGH
3. **MCP Protocol** - HIGH
4. **CLI Commands** - MEDIUM
5. **Testing** - HIGH (alongside each component)
6. **Docker & Documentation** - LOW
