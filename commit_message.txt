feat: Add validation for single-value fields and improve field type guidance

BREAKING CHANGE: The MCP server now enforces single values for simple fields and will automatically trim multiple values to the first one.

## Problem
1. Claude was creating records with multiple values in simple fields (e.g., multiple passwords, emails)
2. Claude was using incorrect field structures for complex types (e.g., bankRoutingNumber instead of bankAccount.routingNumber)

## Solution
1. **Enhanced Tool Descriptions**: Updated create_secret and update_secret tool descriptions to:
   - Clarify which fields need single values vs complex structures
   - Include inline examples of ALL complex field structures directly in the tool descriptions
   - Show correct property names for bankAccount, paymentCard, address, phone, etc.

2. **Added Smart Validation**: Implemented validation that:
   - Only enforces single values for simple fields (password, login, email, etc.)
   - Excludes complex fields that require structured data (bankAccount, securityQuestion, address, etc.)
   - Automatically trims multiple values to first value for simple fields only
   - Adds warnings when multiple values are detected and corrected

3. **Improved Field Structure Examples**: Tool descriptions now include:
   - bankAccount: [{accountType:'checking', routingNumber:'123', accountNumber:'456'}]
   - securityQuestion: [{question:'Q?', answer:'A'}]
   - address: [{street1:'', city:'', state:'', zip:''}]
   - phone: [{region:'US', number:'555-1234'}]
   - And all other complex field structures

## Fixed Fields
The validation now correctly handles these complex field types:
- bankAccount (with accountType, routingNumber, accountNumber)
- paymentCard (with cardNumber, cardExpirationDate, cardSecurityCode)
- address (with street1, street2, city, state, country, zip)
- phone (with region, number, ext, type)
- name (with first, middle, last)
- securityQuestion (with question, answer)
- keyPair (with publicKey, privateKey)
- host (with hostName, port)
- And other complex PAM-related fields

This ensures AI models create properly structured records that match KSM SDK expectations.
