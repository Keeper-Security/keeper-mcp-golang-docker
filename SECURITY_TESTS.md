# KSM MCP Security Tests Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive security testing implemented for the KSM MCP server to demonstrate security coverage to the stakeholders.

## Security Test Coverage

### 1. Input Validation Security (`internal/validation/security_test.go`)

Tests protection against 30+ attack vectors including:

- **SQL Injection**: DROP TABLE, UNION SELECT, OR 1=1
- **Command Injection**: Semicolons, backticks, $() syntax, pipes, newlines
- **Path Traversal**: ../, encoded paths, Windows paths
- **XSS Attacks**: Script tags, img onerror, javascript: protocol, data: URLs
- **LDAP Injection**: Wildcards, attribute manipulation
- **NoSQL Injection**: $ne, $regex operators
- **XML Injection**: Entity expansion, CDATA
- **Unicode Attacks**: Null bytes, RTL override, homograph attacks
- **Buffer Overflow**: Long strings, repeated patterns
- **Format String**: %n vulnerabilities

All tests verify that malicious inputs are properly rejected while legitimate inputs are accepted.

### 2. MCP Server Security (`internal/mcp/security_test.go`)

Tests server-level security controls:

- **Attack Vector Testing**: SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, XSS in tool parameters
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- **Session Security**: Requires active sessions for operations
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive fields are automatically masked in responses
- **Message Size Limits**: Prevents memory exhaustion attacks
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Thread-safe operation under load

### 3. Cryptographic Security (`internal/crypto/security_test.go`)

Tests cryptographic properties:

- **Nonce Uniqueness**: Verifies no nonce reuse across 10,000 iterations
- **Ciphertext Randomness**: Same plaintext produces different ciphertexts
- **Tampering Detection**: Modified ciphertexts fail authentication
- **Key Derivation Strength**: Similar passwords produce completely different keys
- **Timing Attack Resistance**: Consistent timing for valid/invalid passwords
- **Password Complexity**: Handles empty, Unicode, emoji, and very long passwords
- **Large Data Encryption**: Tested up to 10MB files
- **Concurrent Encryption**: Thread-safe under 100 concurrent operations

### 4. Key Security Features Demonstrated

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and sanitization
2. **Fail Secure**: All validation errors result in safe denial of operation
3. **No Information Leakage**: Error messages don't reveal system internals
4. **Strong Cryptography**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)
5. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with rate limiting
6. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
7. **Output Encoding**: Prevents injection of malicious content in responses

## Running Security Tests

To run all security tests:

```bash
# Run all security tests
go test ./internal/validation ./internal/mcp ./internal/crypto -run "Security|TestNonce|TestKey|TestEncryptedData|TestLarge|TestPassword|TestConcurrent" -v

# Run specific security test suites
go test ./internal/validation -run "TestValidator_Security" -v
go test ./internal/mcp -run "TestServer_Security" -v
go test ./internal/crypto -run "TestEncryptor_Security" -v
```

## Security Test Results

All security tests pass successfully, demonstrating:

- ✅ Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- ✅ Strong cryptographic implementation
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Rate limiting and DoS protection
- ✅ Safe error handling
- ✅ Thread-safe concurrent operations
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation

## Compliance

The security implementation aligns with:

- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- NIST Cryptographic Standards (AES-256, PBKDF2)
- Enterprise Security Best Practices
- Zero Trust Security Model

This comprehensive security testing demonstrates that the KSM MCP server has been built with security as a primary concern and is suitable for enterprise deployment in security-conscious environments.
